### Explanation:

1. **HTML Structure**:

   - Includes input fields for the title, note, and category of the card.
   - An "Add Card" button to add new cards.
   - A container (`cardsContainer`) to hold all the dynamically created cards.

2. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - **createCardHTML Function**: Generates the HTML for a card with the given parameters.
   - **addCard Function**: Handles the creation of a new card. It generates a unique ID, gets the current date, creates the card HTML, inserts it into the DOM, and adds event listeners for the edit and delete buttons.
   - **editCard Function**: Handles the editing of a card. It prompts the user for new values for the title, note, and category, and updates the card in the DOM.
   - **deleteCard Function**: Handles the deletion of a card. It removes the card element from the DOM.
   - **Initialization**: Sets up an event listener on the "Add Card" button to handle the form submission. It retrieves the values from the input fields, validates them, and calls `addCard` to create a new card.

This setup allows you to dynamically create, read, update, and delete cards using only JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. Each operation is handled within the JavaScript code, and the HTML structure remains clean and simple.

### Explanation:

1. **HTML Structure**:

   - Added input fields and a button to add new cards.
   - A container (`cardsContainer`) to hold all the dynamically created cards.

2. **JavaScript Logic**:

   - **createCardHTML Function**: Generates the HTML for a card with the given parameters.
   - **addCard Function**: Handles the creation of a new card. It generates a unique ID, gets the current date, creates the card HTML, inserts it into the DOM, and saves the card to local storage.
   - **editCard Function**: Handles the editing of a card. It prompts the user for new values for the title, note, and category, updates the card in the DOM, and updates the card in local storage.
   - **deleteCard Function**: Handles the deletion of a card. It removes the card element from the DOM and removes the card from local storage.
   - **Local Storage Functions**: Handles saving, updating, and removing cards from local storage.
   - **loadCardsFromLocalStorage Function**: Loads cards from local storage when the page loads and renders them in the DOM.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Sets up an event listener on the "Add Card" button to handle the form submission. It retrieves the values from the input fields, validates them, and calls `addCard` to create a new card.
   - Loads cards from local storage when the page loads.

This setup allows you to dynamically create, read, update, and delete cards using only JavaScript and Tailwind CSS, with data persisted in local storage.
